# pixi-ts-quickstart

This repo can be used as a minimal springboard for developing a pixijs app. The main.ts file has all the boilerplate code needed to get started.

## dependencies
the package.json comes pre-ins


## usage
- cd into the repo, and run `npm i` to fetch all the dependencies.
- edit the source typescript file(s) in the `src` folder and run `npm run dev` in the terminal to launch the vite server
- in a separate terminal, you can also run `npm run watch` to run the typescript compiler in watch mode
